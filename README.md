## DrSloth/tokio-modbus
Fork of [fdlg/tokio-modbus](https://github.com/fdlg/tokio-modbus) which is a fork of 
[slowtec/tokio-modbus](https://github.com/slowtec/tokio-modbus)

This fork includes some quick and hacky adaptations to handle the RTU Bus more accurately.
It will be possible to handle incoming Slave ids in the server and also the option to not send a 
response is added. Another thing that will be made possible is returning exception responses.
